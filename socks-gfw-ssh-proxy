### How To Route Web Traffic Securely Without a VPN Using a SOCKS Tunnel

$ ssh -D 8123 -f -C -q -N user@example.com

Explanation of arguments
-D: Tells SSH that we want a SOCKS tunnel on the specified port number (you can choose a number between 1025-65536)
-f: Forks the process to the background
-C: Compresses the data before sending it
-q: Uses quiet mode
-N: Tells SSH that no command will be sent once the tunnel is up

Be sure to replace user@example.com with your own sudo user and server IP address or domain name.
Once you enter the command, you'll immediately be brought to the command prompt again with no sign of success or failure; that's normal.

Verify that the tunnel is up and running with this command:

$ ps aux | grep ssh

You should see a line in the output like:

Output:
user    14345   0.0  0.0  2462228    452   ??  Ss    6:43AM   0:00.00 ssh -D 8123 -f -C -q -N user@example.com
